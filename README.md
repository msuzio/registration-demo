An application to provide three functions:
* A Registration Form with basic personal information
  * information entry provides auto-fill on compliant browsewrs
  * Information entry is validated client-side
  * data is submitted to a REST API, and a confirmation response returned
* The confirmation data is shown to the user
* A report page is provided to display all registered users

# Acknowledgments
* The stub of this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.
* API code adapted from [Heroku MEAN Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api).
   * See [See Virtue #1](http://threevirtues.com/) for motivation; Nevertheless, the general approach with Express and Mongo is fairly cookie-cutter in any case.
* [Angular.io](http://angular.io), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) for filling in my imperfect Angular knowledge.
