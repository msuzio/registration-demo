# Acknowledgments
* This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.
* API code adapted from [Heroku MEAN Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api).
 * See [See Virtue #1](http://threevirtues.com/) for motivation; Nevertheless, the general approach is fairly cookie-cutter in any case
